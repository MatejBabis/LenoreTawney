# Lenore Tawney's Ink Drawings

Back in December 2017 when I visited Tate Modern, I became fascinated with the work of American artist [Lenore Tawney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenore_Tawney), especially her [ink drawings](https://lenoretawney.org/lenore-tawney/work/drawing/) on graph paper. I took an inspiration in her work and started creating my own artworks. The process is almost meditating as it requires a lot of focus, with aesthetically pleasing results (well sometimes, unfortunately).

What I've found is that it might be sometimes difficult to envision what a final drawing might will exactly look like. Creating the artwork is meticulous & time-demanding, and a simplified practice study is often inaccurate.

This simple notebook provides functions that can be used to test out artwork designs, only with the help of [NumPy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/) and [Matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/). I've found this helpful when exploring different layouts, positions or connections among objects. Lines can be moved about, rotated, mirrored etc. and the result is displayed on a canvas mimicking a graph paper, ready to be made into a real thing.
